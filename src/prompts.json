His memories of the hall were hazy, as if coming to him from a long-lost dream; the more he focused on them the quicker they seemed to melt away.\n\nHe was sure of one thing, though. The Great Hall of Porice had been home to the Emerald Chair. He wasn't sure why that was important, but the clarity of the thought was in such contrast to his other vague recollections that he knew it must be true. He would have staked his life on it.\n\nThe ground he stood on had once been the place of majesty. Tomin let his mind again slip into both memory and non-memory.\n\n"

Of course, you could still go there -- people did all the time -- but since the Great Awakening had begun Earth was much more of a curiosity than a place to be. It all started when Helios first came online. That's what people meant when they referred to the Great Awakening: the birth of Helios, the first truly artificial general intelligence.\n\nWhen Helios first came online it was regarded as more of a curiosity than what it was -- the herald of a new age."
