His memories of the hall were hazy, as if coming to him from a long-lost dream; the more he focused on them the quicker they seemed to melt away.\n\nHe was sure of one thing, though. The Great Hall of Porice had been home to the Emerald Chair. He wasn't sure why that was important, but the clarity of the thought was in such contrast to his other vague recollections that he knew it must be true.\n\n\"Why am I even here?\" He wondered aloud.\n\nOf course, he knew the answer â€“ had known since he first set out on the perilous journey across from his home town to this now seemingly insignificant plot of long-forgotten rubble.\n\nThe Emerald Chair.\n\nOver and over, in his sleeping dreams and waking thoughts, he felt its call. Like a faint echo ever fading into silence, it came to him in whispers, urging him onward, compelling him to find it, to hold it, and to claim it as his own. There were times when Tomin would have sworn that he could actually hear the voice of the great wooden throne repeating the words over and over again: You must bring me back. You must, you must, you must.\n\nTomin sighed heavily, his breath expelling itself in a long exhalation, and pulled a well-worn cloth map from the pouch tied to his belt. Carefully unfolding it, he smoothed its torn fibers onto the rocky terrain, making every effort to ignore the harsh sunlight as he squinted down at the faded lines and wrinkles."

Of course, you could still go there -- people did all the time -- but since the Great Awakening had begun Earth was much more of a curiosity than a place to be. It all started when Helios first came online. That's what people meant when they referred to the Great Awakening: the birth of Helios, the first truly artificial general intelligence.\n\nWhen Helios first came online it was regarded as more of a curiosity than what it was -- the herald of a new age."
